# Signals

Signals are software interrupts.\
\
They provide a way to handle asynchronous events. \ 
\
Signal names are all defined by positive integer constants (signal number) in `<sigal.h>`. None has a sig num 0, POSIX.1 calls it *null signal*. \
\
Many conditions can generate a si9gnal:
- Terminal-generated when users press certain terminal keys. e.g CTRL+C normally causes SIGINT
- Hardware exceptions: divide by 0, invalid mem reference etc . These are usually detected by the hardware.
- `kill(2)` function allows a process send any signals to other process or process group. We have to be the owner of the process we're sending to, or be the superuser.
- `kill(1)` command allows to send signals to other processes. This program is just an interface to `kill` function. Its often used to terminate a runaway background process.
- software conditions can generate signals when a process should be notifued of various events. These arent hardware-generated conditions (as in div-by-o condition), but software conditions. E.G \
SIGURG (gened when out-of-band data arrives over a net conn) \
SIGIPE (when a process writes to a pipe that has no reader) \
SIGALRM (when an alarm clock set by process expires) \
\
Signals are async events. THey occur at random times to the process. Process cant simply test a variable (e.g `errno`) to see whether a signal has occured. It has to tell kernel **if and when this signal occurs, do the following**. \
\
We can tell kernel to do one of these at signal (i.e disposition of a signal):
1. Ignore signal: works for most signal except `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` (This is to provide kernel and superuser a sure way to kill/stop any proc). Also, ignoring signals gened by hardware exception, process behavior will be undefined.
2. Catch signal: Tell kernel to call a function of ours whenever signal occurs. `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cant be caught.
3. Let default action apply. Every signal has a default action. FOr most signals is to terminate process.

## signal Function

Simplest interface to the signal features of UNIX system is `signal` function. \
\
```c
#include <signal.h>
void (*signal(int signo, void (*func)(int))) (int);
// returns previous disposition of signal if OK, SIG_ERR on error
```

It returns a function pointer, which is the previous signal handler. \
\
**signo** is the name of the signal \
\
**func** is either:
1. constant `SIG_IGN` (ignore)
2. constant `SIG_DFL` (default) 
3. address of a function to be called when signal occurs.

Many systems call the handler with additional, implementation-dependent arguments.

The `signal` function protoype above can be simplified through use of the following `typedef`:
```c
typedef void Sigfunc(int);
```
Then the prototype becomes
```c
Sigfunc *signal(int, Sigfunc*);
```

## Program startup

When a program is executed, the status of all signals is either default or ignore. Normally, all signals are set to their default action, unless the process that calls `exec` is ignoringn the signal.\
\
`exec` changes the disposition of any signals being caught to their default action and leave the status of all other signals alone. Naturally, a signal that us being caught by a process that calls `exec` cannt be caught by the same functipn in the new program, since the address of the catching func in the caller probably has no meaning in the new program file that is executed. \
\
Example is how an interactiive shell treats the interrupt and quit signals for a background process. With a shell that doesnt support job control, when we execute a process in the background, as in
```c
cc main.c &
```
shell automatically sets the disposition of the interrupt (`SIGINT`) and quit (`SIGQUIT`) signals in the bg process to be ignored. So that interrupt character for example doesnt affect bg proc. If not both fore and bag process are terminated. \
interractive programs that catch these two signals have code like ths:
```c
// catching SIGINT and SIGQUIT in a child process with new program. The process catches the signal only if the signal is not currently ignored

void sig_int(int), sig_quit(int);

if (signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN) != SIG_IGN)
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int)
if (signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN) != SIG_IGN)
    signal(SIGQUIT, sig_quit)
```
These two calls to signal also show a limitation of `signal`: we are not able to determine the current disposition of a signal without changing the disposition. `sigaction` function allows us to determine a signalâ€™s disposition without changing it.

## Process Creation

When a process calls `fork`, the child inherits the parent's signal dispositions. Here, since the child starts off with a copy of parent's memory image, the address of a signal-catching function has meaning in the child.

## Reentrant Functions

When a signal that is being caught is handled by a process, the normal sequence of instructions being executed by the process is temporarily interrupted by the signal handler. \
The process then continues executing, but the instructions in the signal handler are now executed. If the signal handler returns (instead of calling `exit` or `longjmp`, for example), then the normal sequence of instructions that the process was executing when the signal was caught continues executing. (this is similar to what happens when a hardware interrupt occurs.) But in the signal handler, we cant tell where the process was executing when the signal was caught. WHat if the porocess was in the middle of allocating additional memory on its heap using `malloc`, and we call `malloc` from the signal handler? Or if the process was in the middle of a call to a function, such as `getpwnam`, the info returned to the normal caller can get overwritten with the info returned to the sigal handler. \
\
The Single UNIX spec specifies **the func that are guaranteed to be safe to call form within a sig handler. These are reentrant and are called *async-signal safe* by the Spec**. Besides being reentrant, **they block any signals during operation if delivery of a signal might cause inconsistencies**. \
\
These functions are: \
`abort`, `accept`, `close`, `bind` etc **(others are on page 365/331)** \
\
Most of the funcs that are not incuded are not because \
1. they are known to use static data structures
2. they call `malloc` or `free`
3. they are part of standard I/O library. Most implementations in the std I/O library use global data structures in a nonreentrant way. **Note that even though we call `printf` from signal handlers in some of our examples, it is not guaranteed to produce expected results, since the signal handler can interrupt a call to `print` from main program. \
\
Even if we call a function among the above listed from a sig handler, there is only one `errno` variable per thread (recall discussion of errno and threads in sec 1.7) and we might potentially modify its value. COnsider a sig handler that is invoked right after `main` has et `errno`. If the signal handler calls `read`, for example, this call can change the value of `errno`, wiping out the value that was just stored in `main`. Therefore, as a general rule, when calling the functions listed above from a signal handler, we should save and restore `errno`. **Note that a commonly caught signal is SIGCHLD, and its signal handler usually calls one of the `wait` functions. All `wait` funcs can change  `errno`** \
\
Note that `longjmp` and `siglongjmp` are missing from d funcs cos the signal may have occured while the main routine was updating a data structure in a nonreentrant way. This data structure could be left half updated if we call `siglongjmp` instead of returning from the signal handler. If it is going to do such things as update global data structures, as we describe here, while catching dignals that cause `sigsetjmp` to be executed,,an application needs to block the signals while updating the data structures.
