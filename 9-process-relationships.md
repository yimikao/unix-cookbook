Programs that are executed when we log in to a UNIX system. In early UNIX systems, users logged in using dumb terminals connectedt to host with hard-wired connections. As graphical terminals became available, applications were developed to create "terminal windows" to emlate character-based terminals, allowing users interact with hosts in familiar ways (i.e via shell command line). \
